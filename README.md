# Text-Analyzer
To explore how Python allows modular programming through functions, and how textual data (strings) can be analyzed, transformed, and manipulated.
‚úÖ Objective:
To explore how Python allows modular programming through functions, and how textual data (strings) can be analyzed, transformed, and manipulated.

üîç Activities Performed:
Studied how to create and call user-defined functions.

Learned about arguments, parameters, and the role of return values in reusable logic.

Gained hands-on experience with string manipulation techniques such as capitalization, substring extraction, search operations, and replacements.

Emphasized understanding of string indexing and slicing.

üñ•Ô∏è Output Observation:
Output screens showed greetings, formatted strings, and processed text based on user input or internal logic. The correctness of transformations validated the effectiveness of string operations.

üí° Key Concepts Learned:
Functions help in organizing and reusing code, making it cleaner and modular.

Strings, though simple, have rich capabilities and can be altered extensively.

Using functions improves maintainability and structure of larger programs.

üß† Reflections:
This week provided a major leap in understanding how large programs are built using smaller, reusable blocks. String operations taught the importance of data formatting and presentation. Overall, it gave a more professional feel to the programming experience.
